ggmap 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES
 
* a vast array of new kinds of maps are available to the user.  these are based on stamen maps (http://maps.stamen.com/watercolor/) and cloudmade maps (http://maps.cloudmade.com/).  the latter allows for user-designed map rendering (http://maps.cloudmade.com/editor#).

* the full google static maps api is available to the user.  in particular, this allows for double the image resolution of google maps (which is also now the default).

* qmplot - a version of qplot (from ggplot2) which automatically determines, downloads, and plots the result on the appropriate map.  this function is still experimental.

* make_bbox - a function which determines an appropriate bounding box for a collection of longitude/latitude pairs.

CHANGES

* ggmap now imports all packages save ggplot2 instead of depending on them.
* ggmapplot no longer uses a textConnection for parsing base_layer.
* geocode fixes/changes :
	a. gcdf is no longer a global variable
	b. geocode now properly uses the google geocoding api (like revgeocode)
	c. geocodeQueryCheck watches your query limit with hidden global variable .GoogleGeocodeQueryCount
* verbose argument in function ggmap now deprecated, use messaging
* center argument in function ggmap now deprecated, use location
* the ggmap function has been totally overhauled.  it is no longer based on the RgoogleMaps functions GetMap and GetMap.OSM but on functions get_googlemap, get_openstreetmap, get_stamenmap, and get_cloudmademap.  
* ggimage has been rebased on ggmap:::geom_raster (a version of ggplot2's geom_raster which smooths).
* ggmap's version of annotation_raster and annotation_custom are now exported as inset_raster and inset.

FUNCTION NAME CHANGES

* the function called ggmap in previous versions is now called get_map.
* the function called ggmapplot in previous versions is now called ggmap.  the new ggmap function checks its arguments and then either 1. proceeds with generating a ggplot2 object or 2. errors suggesting the use of get_map.

FIXES

* bug was fixed which on some platforms caused an error in readPNG.
* mapdist now properly handles many from queries without exceeding google's distance matrix api uri limits.  note that the api may still reject large queries - you may want to run mapdist in a for loop.

NEW DEPENDS/IMPORTS/SUGGESTS

* ggmap no longer imports ReadImages.
* ggmap now suggests stringr.

OTHER ADDITIONS

* a new data set on wind from hurricane ike (from NOAA).




Version 1.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features -
  1. a total overhaul of the geocode function (with backwards compatability).  geocode can now return more information such as the address (for when the location is lazy-specified, e.g. "the white house"), a bounding box, and political administrative bodies.
  2. revgeocode - a reverse geocoder using google maps.
  3. mapdist - a function to compute distances on maps using the google maps api.  distances in meters, km, and miles are returned as well as travel times in seconds, minutes and hours based on mode of transportation (driving, bicycling, or walking).  google query limit monitored with function distQueryCheck.
  4. route - a function to grab directions from google.  google query limit monitored with function routeQueryCheck. several options are available.
  5. qmap now accepts base_layer argument.

Fixes -
  1. qmap and ggmapplot now deal properly with maprange.
 *2. the coordinate system is now properly set to a mercator projection.
  3. custom version of annotation_custom added (not exported) to allow for placement in and plotting of overlays with mercator projection.

New depends -
  1. rjson




Version 1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions -
  1. ggmapplot now accepts arguments base_layer, maprange, and expand.  base_layer is a ggplot(aes(.), .)  call which allows the user to specify the base layer of the plot which, when left unspecified, defaults to the four corners of the map.  maprange allows the user to set the x and y axis limits to the boundary of the map, and expand eliminates the white border space placed around the map.  this also allows for faceting the map plots, see ggmapplot examples.
  2. qmap's arguments properly handled.
  3. OSM_scale_lookup used for better scale choices with OpenStreetMaps.
  4. gglocator added following ggplot2 forum discussion by Tyler Rinker.






Version 1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes -
  ggimage and ggmapplot are now properly based on annotation_raster.  the custom geom_raster (and related dependence) has been removed.  dependence on proto removed.

Additions -
  1. theme_inset which allows for easy inset theming (exported)
  2. ggmap now takes latitude longitude ranges for OpenStreetMaps 

Fixes -
  1. qmap now properly sets the fullpage(=TRUE) argument when unspecified.
  2. ggmap now properly provides a black and white image when specified.




Version 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ggimage and ggmapplot are now based on geom_raster (new in ggplot2 as of version 0.9.0).




Version 0.8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes - 
1. Further updated examples for a more efficient R CMD check.
2. ggmap now calls geocode (see below) for geocoding.
3. packages now load quietly.
4. grid now imported.
5. ggmap updated to ggplot2 version 0.9.0 which involved changes :
	1. legend = FALSE changed to guide = 'none' in ggimage, ggmapplot
	2. in ggimage examples, aesthetic "colour" changed to "colours"
	3. in ggmapplot examples, argument "to" in scale_size changed to "range"
6. .Internal calls in ggimage and ggmap for color conversion changed to simple rgb calls.

Additions - 
1. The geocoding subroutine of ggmap has been converted to its own function called geocode, which is exported.

Version 0.7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes - Examples not run at R CMD check.

Version 0.6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes - ggimage and ggmap now properly reshape using the reshape2 package.

Version 0.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes - ggimage changed to display coord_equal by default.

Version 0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGE GENESIS.
